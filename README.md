# String Calculator â€“ Incubyte TDD Assessment

This project is a solution to the Incubyte TDD assessment. It follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Ruby using RSpec. The goal was to build a simple String Calculator class by writing tests first, incrementally adding functionality, and keeping the code clean and readable.
